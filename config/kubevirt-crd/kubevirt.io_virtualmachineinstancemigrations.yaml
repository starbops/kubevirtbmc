                        description: |-
                          AllowPostCopy enables post-copy live migrations. Such migrations allow even the busiest VMIs
                          to successfully live-migrate. However, events like a network failure can cause a VMI crash.
                          If set to true, migrations will still start in pre-copy, but switch to post-copy when
                          CompletionTimeoutPerGiB triggers. Defaults to false

                        description: |-
                          CompletionTimeoutPerGiB is the maximum number of seconds per GiB a migration is allowed to take.
                          If a live-migration takes longer to migrate than this value multiplied by the size of the VMI,
                          the migration will be cancelled, unless AllowPostCopy is true. Defaults to 800

                          When set to true, DisableTLS will disable the additional layer of live migration encryption
                          provided by KubeVirt. This is usually a bad idea. Defaults to false

                      matchSELinuxLevelOnMigration:
                        description: |-
                          By default, the SELinux level of target virt-launcher pods is forced to the level of the source virt-launcher.
                          When set to true, MatchSELinuxLevelOnMigration lets the CRI auto-assign a random level to the target.
                          That will ensure the target virt-launcher doesn't share categories with another pod on the node.
                          However, migrations will fail when using RWX volumes that don't automatically deal with SELinux levels.
                        type: boolean
                      network:
                        description: |-
                          Network is the name of the CNI network to use for live migrations. By default, migrations go

                        description: |-
                          ProgressTimeout is the maximum number of seconds a live migration is allowed to make no progress.
                          Hitting this timeout means a migration transferred 0 data for that many seconds. The migration is
                          then considered stuck and therefore cancelled. Defaults to 150
                        format: int64
